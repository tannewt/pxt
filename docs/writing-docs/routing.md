# Routing

The PXT documentation supports a basic file based structure and also allow to inherit pages from various repos, remix them into a final documentation document.

## File structure

PXT assumes that the documentation is located under the ``/docs`` folder. The web site routing follows the file structure:

```
/about -> /docs/about.md
/reference/math -> /docs/reference/math.md
```

Static assets such as picture can be placed under the ``/docs/static`` folder.

## Inheriting docs

Targets inherit main PXT docs for common language features, but can override
parts of each document. 

By default, all upstream PXT docs are visible in the target. They consist mostly of the language
reference. If a target defines a document with a name matching an upstream document, the target's
version will be used. If the target's version includes macro ```# @extends```, then the upstream
version will be used as base and sections in it overridden.

Sections are overridden based on matching their ids. For example, a target's version of
the document above can look as follows:

```markdown
# @â€‹extends
### #ex2
My example
## See Also These! #also
My links
```

Effectively, the resulting markdown will be:

```markdown
## Examples #ex
### Example 1
...
### Example 2 #ex2
My example
### Example 3
...
## See Also These! #also
My links
```

If the title of section is omitted, the title from the upstream version is taken.

Only named sections of the upstream document can be overridden. This is because
of possible mixups related to localization.

Do not introduce new section ids in the target's document - they will appear as errors at the end.
Also, if you were to override a section with nested subsections, like the `ex` section above,
it is not necessary to specify nested subsections again (i.e., `#ex2` can be skipped).

The sections in the upstream document are treated as a tree, following the nesting level
of headers. In the target document, sections stretch from the beginning of a section with
id, until the next section with id starts, that is the tree structure is not required.

## Docs file lookup

The lookup of path `https://some.domain.com/v2/foo/bar` proceeds as follows:
* take the main repo of the target corresponding to `some.domain.com` at branch `v2`
* check if any of `docs/foo/bar-ref.json` or `docs/foo/bar.html` exists; if so use it and stop
* check for `docs/foo/bar.md`
* if it exists and doesn't contain `# @extends` use it and stop
* for every bundled package `P` from `pxtarget.json`, that is not in
  `pxt-common-packages`, look for `P/docs/foo/bar.md`; if found use it and stop (no expansion here)
* get `package.json` and `pxtarget.json` from the main target repo
* check for base file `common-docs/foo/bar.md` in checkout of `pxt-core` branch from `package.json`;
  eg `"dependencies": { "pxt-core": "3.2.1" }` will result in looking into `pxt-core` repo at `v3` branch
* if it fails, for every bundled package `P` from `pxtarget.json` look for base file in the checkout of
  `pxt-common-packages` (version from `package.json`) for `P/docs/foo/bar.md`
* if no base file is found, 404
* otherwise, either server the base file as is, or patch it up using the instructions 
  in Inheriting docs above

If there is say no `v7` branch of a repo, but `package.json` at `master` has `"version": "7.3.1"`,
then `master` is used instead of `v7`.

The lookup of path `https://some.domain.com/foo/bar` where `foo` doesn't look like
`v0`, `v1` etc. proceeds like above but with `master` instead of `v2`.

If the page is requested in non-English language, the `.md` files are first fetched
from crowdin on the same branch as they would have been fetched from the repo (either `master` 
or `vN`).

To see how this resolution applies in a particular target,
you can try to load an non-existing URL - the error page will show you the list of locations
tried. You may need to click a little 'More info' button to see it.
