# Command Line Interface

It is possible to use the tools from the **pxt command line interface (CLI)**. ``pxt`` allows to 

* edit, compile or deploy JavaScript programs
* can easily be integrated in most IDEs. It comes with built-in support for [Visual Studio Code](/code).
* run a local web server for the web editor
* author packages using JavaScript and/or C++

Using the CLI assumes that you have some experience with programming and will require to install tools on your machine as well.
