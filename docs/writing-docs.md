# Writing Docs

PXT provides an integrated solution to build documentation.

* **pxt flavored markdown** the documentation is stored as [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) pages with some additional macros to help with widget formatting.
* **sustainable** all block images are rendered on the fly to avoid having to maintain hundreds of screenshots...
* **localizable** the documentation is synchronized with Crowdin and localize on the fly by the PXT backend
* **reusable** documentation pages can be shared and specialized between targets. It allows to provide a core documentation for the language while specializing the examples.

This page was writting using this documentation system, check it out at https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/blob/master/docs/writing-docs.md.
